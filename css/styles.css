  /** Notes: 
  Form Validation:
  -- how you choose to do your form validation is up to you. You have been supplied with a check and x marks (svgs) to use. Optional fields means that they are not required.

  Images: 
  -- All svgs supplied (see folder)
  -- All full size images supplied but images can also be pulled from the PSD.

  PSD to Completed View: 
  -- in the completed view you'll notice a border around the subscribe form in the footer - this is valid state (style it how looks in the PSD).
  -- The hamburger menu changes on open and closed states - this NOT something that needs to be completed - this would be extra/additional learning.
